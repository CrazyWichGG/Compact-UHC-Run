# Compact UHC Run

This datapack is a compact UHC game that can be installed in every Minecraft map even the custom generated one. 
You can add other features using datapacks or plugins from other creators to enhance your UHC experience such as Tree Capitator, Death Chest, Custom Structure, etc. 

This datapack only changes some game mechanics such as loot tables, recipes, and some gamerules, so most datapacks and plugins should work fine.

ðŸ“¥ For those who download the datapack, if you find any bug or issue in the game. Please report it at the Issue page of this GitHub repository.

## ðŸŽ® How to play

Use `/function install:_` or `/function install:random` (to randomize map center location) then `/function install:confirm` to install the game first.

Then use `/function _:start-game` to start the game. (require at least 2 players to start)

If you want to randomize the new map location, use `/function _:random-center` without any comfirmation.

If you want to uninstall consider using `/function uninstall:_` then `/function uninstall:confirm`
